#CleanChat

This is a chat app that is intended to be, once and for all, the

#ONE CHAT APP TO RULE THEM ALL

Here's a list of what this chat app will be:

-Open source
-Openly documented
-Usable in everyday life for all your chat app needs, that you may have previously used several discrete apps for, all with their advantages and disadvantages
-Cross-platform: This is intended to be the most cross-platform chat app ever made. Users are encouraged to build their own clients using the documentation and source code provided.
-DMs, group messaging, and voice and video chat included and working on all platforms

Right now the backend is built in Node.js with Express, and the web frontend using React. Once proper functionality is achieved, more clients will be built for other platforms and systems, including smartphones.
